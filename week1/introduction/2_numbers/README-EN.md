# Number manipulations
## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg)

Design an algorithm, potentially starting with pseudocode, to perform the following number manipulations. Then, implement these algorithms within the provided method bodies.

`int reverse(int number)`:<br>
reverses an integer<br>
_(e.g. `reverse(1234) -> 4321`)_

`boolean isPalindrome(int number)`:<br> checks whether an integer is a palindrome<br>
_(e.g. `isPalindrome(1331) -> true`, `isPalindrome(1234) -> false`<br>
A palindrome number reads the same forward and backward.)_


`boolean isPrime(int number)`: <br>checks whether a number is a prime number<br>
_(e.g. `isPrime(5) -> true` 5 is a prime number as its only divisors are 1 and 5 itself<br>
`isPrime(12) -> false` 12 is not a prime number as 12 can (atleast) be divided by 4)_

The given `NumbersMain` program contains a base structure for the solution and contains a few tests. You can add a few tests
of your own
