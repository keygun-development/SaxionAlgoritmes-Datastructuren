## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg)

Create a program that sequentially reads words from the terminal until an empty string is entered. Upon receiving the empty string, the program should display a line containing the entered words in reverse order, followed by the line in its original order.

### TODO
Implement the `run()` method in the `Reverser` class according to the above description.

#### example output:
```
Enter word: fear
Enter word: of
Enter word: weakness
Enter word: only
Enter word: strenghtens
Enter word: weakness
Enter word: 

Words in reverse order: weakness strenghtens only weakness of fear
Words in normal order: fear of weakness only strenghtens weakness
```

### Hints:
- You have the full implementation of the `IADDoublyLinkedList` from the previous exercise at your disposal, with every utility method.
