# Counting characters
## Moeilijkheid: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg)
When deciphering a password it sometimes can help to find out how often a character occurs. If for example the character 'L' often occurs in a text there is a big chance it is the cypher for a character that occurs often in natural texts (for example a 'e' or an 'a').


Write a function that can read a text and then returns how often a specific character occurs. Use an array to store the occurrence of a character.

## Expected outcome:
`The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, and drew up outside the inn. The houses looked large and strange to them. Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows, and felt his heart sink. He had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees, and other creatures even more terrify- ing, some time or other in the course of his journey; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of Men and their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day. He pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the inn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows.`
