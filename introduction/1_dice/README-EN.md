## Difficulty: ![Filled](../resources/star-filled.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg) ![Outlined](../resources/star-outlined.svg)

Create algorithms for dice throwing and determine the fairness of these algorithms.

- Before programming: determine a strategy
  - what datastructure are you going to use?
  - what would be a good algorithm?
- Implement the `throwDice()` and `throwUnfairDice()` methods in a manner of your preference
- Write java code (`DiceMain`) that implements your strategy
  - how fair is your `throwDice()` method?
  - how fair is your `throwUfairDice()` method?
